            People continue to leave the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela due to the complex socioeconomic, human rights and political situation. Since 2015, 2.7 million Venezuelans have left, mainly to neighbouring countries, with no prospects of return in the short to medium term. Their primary destinations were Colombia, Peru, ...and services, including access to health and education systems, to those arriving. More support by the international community is needed to complement their efforts.

        Diagnosing children with ADHD is complicated. Several other DSM-5 disorders, also found in children, appear to overlap significantly with this disorder. Specifically, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, and bipolar disorder all have characteristics seen in children with ADHD. ODD is a DSM-5 disorder that includes behaviors such as “often loses temper,” “argues with adults,” “often deliberately annoys people,” “touchy and easily annoyed by others,” and “often spiteful and vindictive” (Toth, de Lacy, & King, 2016). The impulsivity and hyperactivity observed in children with ADHD can manifest themselves in some of these symptoms. Similarly, conduct disorder—which, as you saw in Chapter 12, can be a precursor to antisocial personality disorder—is also observed in many children with ADHD (Toth et al., 2016). Bipolar disorder—which, you will recall from Chapter 7, is one of the mood disorders—also overlaps significantly with ADHD (Pliszka, 2015). This overlap can complicate diagnosis in these children.
