            People continue to leave the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela due to the complex socioeconomic, human rights and political situation. Since 2015, 2.7 million Venezuelans have left, mainly to neighbouring countries, with no prospects of return in the short to medium term. Their primary destinations were Colombia, Peru, ...and services, including access to health and education systems, to those arriving. More support by the international community is needed to complement their efforts.

        <b> DSM 5 </b> <br>
        <b>Table 14.2: Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Learning Disorder </b>
        <br> From American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC. 
        <p></p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li> Difficulty learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months, despite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>  Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incorrectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has
                        difficulty sounding out words). </li>
                    <li> Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).</li>
                    <li> Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants). </li>
                    <li>  Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization, written expression of ideas lacks clarity).</li>
                    <li>Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships;
                        counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures. </li>
                    <li> Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems). </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual’s chronological age and cause significant
                interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individually administered standardized
                achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals aged 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing learning
                difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment. </li>
            <li> The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills
                exceed the individual’s limited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy, complex reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy
                academic loads). </li>
            <li> The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological
                disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction. </li>
        </ol>
<br> 
<b> Note: </b> The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on clinical synthesis of the individual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational),
school reports, and psychoeducational assessment.
Specify if:
<br>
<b> With impairment in reading: </b>
<ul>
   <li> Word reading accuracy </li>
   <li> Reading rate or fluency </li>
   <li> Reading comprehension </li>

</uL>


<b> With impairment in expression: </b>
<ul> 
  <li> Spelling accuracy </li>  
  <li> Grammar and punctuation accuracy </li>  
  <li> Clarity or organization of written expression </li>  

</ul>


<b> With impairment in mathematics: </b>
<ul>
   <li> Number sense  </li> 
   <li> Memorization of arithmetic facts  </li> 
   <li> Accurate or fluent calculation  </li> 
   <li> Accurate math reasoning  </li> 
</ul>
